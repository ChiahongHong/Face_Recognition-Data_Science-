# FACE RECOGITION
# USING SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE(SVM)

**This is a Face Recognition of Oivetti database of face images from AT&T research lab. It includes 400 faces (64x64 pixels) from 40 people (10 images per person).**

# The goal is to build a Face Recognition algorithm to recognize each person using PCA dimensionality reduction and a non-linear SVM.

## Software Requirements 
1.) **Check the version of python in your machine by using python -V command from your terminal or command prompt, if nothing happened then install python from (https://www.python.org/downloads/).**

2.)**Also you need to install Anaconda to use the jupyter Notebook (https://anaconda.org/) or you can use Juptyer Notebook Online as (http://jupyter.org/try)**

3.) **Clone the project from this GitHub repo.**

3.) **If your are using offline version of Jupyter then from jupyter notebook browse your File System, select folder from the File Sysetm where you clone the REPO --> users/fake_path/face_recognition_DataScience.**

4.) **Once you navtigate to the target folder and opened the Face_Recognition.ipynb**

5.) **Run all the command we will have the desired output for each image.**
